1.  `CFVD.xlsx` is the Cross-Function Vulnerability Dataset (CFVD) for C/C++ open-source software we built. The dataset involves 704 CVE vulnerabilities, each of which is labeled with its patch statements, its vulnerability-triggering statements, being cross-function or not, the type of cross-function vulnerability, and the se- quence of functions starting from the vulnerable function to the vulnerability-triggering function, etc.
2. `./DIFF_NEW_OLD` contains all the CVE data required by the paper, including patch files, vulnerability files and non-vulnerability files for each CVE.
