## Cross-Function Vulnerability Dataset (CFVD) ##

1.  `CFVD.xlsx` is the CFVD of vulnerabilities of C/C++ open-source software we built. The dataset involves 704 CVE vulnerabilities, each of which is labeled with its patch statements, its vulnerability-triggering statements, being cross-function or not, the type of cross-function vulnerability, and the se- quence of functions starting from the vulnerable function to the vulnerability-triggering function, etc.
2.  `./DIFF_NEW_OLD`: This folder contains diff files, vulnerable files, and non-vulnerability files for 704 CVEs.
